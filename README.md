# BrewDog

A basic BrewDog search app, which uses an API as a data source:

**Programming Language**: JavaScript

**Web App Framework**: Vue

**Markup/Styling**: HTML5/CSS3

The BrewDog app can dynamically search data requested from an API and return details stored for a corresponding result. It can add a beer to a favourite beer list and also remove a chosen beer. The same beer cannot be added twice. The app can also view ingredients for a specific beer.

This exercise was tasked to me by CodeClan, Glasgow where I studied towards a PDA Level 8 in Professional Software Development. The exercise brief can be found below.

# Brief

Your task is to build an app that uses this API to display information on a variety of beers.

**MVP**

Your app should be able to:

- Allow the user to view all the beers
- Allow the user to view more detailed information on a selected beer
- Allow the user to mark beers as ‘favourites’
- Display the user’s favourite beers

**Extensions**

- Prevent the user from marking the same beer as a favourite more than once
- Allow the user to deselect favourite beers
- Display the selected beer’s ingredients (without duplicates)
- The endpoint provided will only return 20 beers at a time. Modify your initial request to fetch all 300+ beers the API provides.
